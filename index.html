 <!--I found this space for you and I
 Where we can both think just the same
 We don't need these things like time
 We can dream them all away-->
 
<!--I was born to believe that the change in the leaves could really mean anything, love
I'd cross the mountains and the ocean for you
Just to see you-->

 <!--The night will hold us close
 and the stars will guide us home
 I've been waiting for this moment
 We're finally alone-->
 
 <!--As the water rises up, sun is sinking down
 And the stars will guide us home
 I've been waiting for this moment
 We're finally alone-->
