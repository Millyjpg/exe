<h2>there's nothing here. </h2>


 
<!--I found this space for you and I
Where we can both think just the same
We don't need these things like time
We can dream them all away

I was born to believe that the change in the leaves could really mean anything, love
I'd cross the mountains and the ocean for you
Just to see you

The night will hold us close
And the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment
We're finally alone

As the water rises up, sun is sinking down
And now all I can see are the planets in a row
Suggesting it's best that I slow down

I could have lost myself
In rough blue waters in your eyes
And I miss you still

I wish you could see what I see when I'm seeing you
I want you to know how I know that I need you 

I like the sound of your heartbeat
Your pulse is pushing against me
I'm good when you are around

I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing

You're making me a little crazy
With every little thing that you do
But if there's one thing I'm sure of
I know I wanna be with you-->
